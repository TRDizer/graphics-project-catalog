## CSC417/CSC2549 Physics-based Animation
> Physically based animation is an area of interest within computer graphics concerned with the simulation of physically plausible behaviors at interactive rates. 
> 
> The course serves as an introduction to the field of physics-based animation by exposing underlying mathematical and algorithmic techniques required to understand 
> and develop efficient numerical simulations of physical phenomena such as rigid bodies, deformable bodies and fluids.

## CSC419/CSC2520 Geometry Processing
> Geometry processing, or mesh processing, is an area of research that uses concepts from applied mathematics, computer science and engineering to design efficient algorithms 
> for the acquisition, reconstruction, analysis, manipulation, simulation and transmission of complex 3D models.
>
> The course focuses on algorithms and mathematics behind fundamental operations for interpreting and manipulating geometric data. These essential tools enable: geometric modeling
> for computer aided design, life-like animations for computer graphics, reliable physical simulations, and robust scene representations for computer vision.
